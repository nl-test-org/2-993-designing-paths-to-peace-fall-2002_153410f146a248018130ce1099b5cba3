| WEEK 1 |
| --- |
|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} **Classroom Topic:** Understanding Visual Language/The Design Process {{< br >}}{{< br >}} *   Why does an art work look the way it does? How does it express what the artist was trying to say? How does it express its age/culture? How/what can we learn from these examples?{{< br >}}*   Introduction to a design process (FRFRDPARC, Individual thinking, Peer Review, Brainstorming){{< br >}}*   Introduction to computer programs for use in the class (solid modeling, web-based peer review, waterjet cutter path planning) {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| **Discussion:** Art Forms, Inlays, Mosaics, Stencils, Art in the context of its time. |
| **Homework to present**: Each person has 2 minutes to initially describe (non-binding spur of the moment thoughts) what message they would like to convey in a tile that is personally of interest to them. Then, teams will be formed accordingly. |
| **Homework to start:** Create initial team website. Start solid modeling self-tutorial and complete your design for your inlay (e.g., solid model of your name where the letters are parts and the waterjet-cut tile and wood frame are also parts, then put it all together as an assembly). Research strategies for tile designs-subject, form, content-using library, internet, museums, brainstorming techniques, etc. Complete readings for next week in preparation for classroom discussion/presentation. |
| **Laboratory activity:** Waterjet training with John DiFrancesco and schedule time the following week for teams to come in and make their inlays. Class visit to the Museum of Fine Arts. 

| WEEK 2 |

|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} **Classroom Topic:** Art as Cultural Heritage {{< br >}}{{< br >}} *   Art as a means of expression and an alternative to violence{{< br >}}*   Examination and explorations of students' heritages, personal preferences and relevance to their tile research/design{{< br >}}*   Critiquing and comparing design research {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| **Discussion:** Can art help prevent human tragedies, and how can art be designed to help us respond to tragedies? Art works and their sites, art in the context of its surroundings.  {{< br >}}How does art reflect its larger communities' aspirations and beliefs? |
| **Homework to present**: Teams show the results of their design process (individual, PREP, brainstorm sessions) and how it yielded a design strategy for their tiles: what overall message is to be projected and how in general will it be achieved? |
| **Homework to start:** Create concepts for tile designs. Self-guided tour to Harvard Sackler Museum: analyze an art work. Update website. Readings on Materials in preparation for the trip to the tile shop. |
| **Laboratory activity:** Safety training at the Hobby Shop, and start planned project to gain experience in the Hobby Shop. Complete inlay cutting on waterjet as previously scheduled with John DiFrancesco. Using the Waterjet cutter. Teams self-tour of MIT public art. 

| WEEK 3 |

|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} **Classroom Topic:** Art in the Context of its Physical Surroundings {{< br >}}{{< br >}} *   Evolving final designs: How to translate research into visual images, thumbnail sketches, tracing paper trials, construction paper, magazine papers to determine colors, etc. (collage){{< br >}}*   Grid method of enlarging and detailing concepts{{< br >}}*   Manufacturing and materials considerations{{< br >}}*   In-class review of concepts, and selection of final concept {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| **Homework to present:** Teams show the results of their design process (individual, PREP, brainstorm sessions) and how it yielded a design concept for their tiles. What are the principle modules and which team members are responsible for which modules? |
| **Homework to start:** Final, full-scale layout of the tiles, completed as a solid model. Show several different color schemes with different illumination sources (using the shading and rendering tools in the solid modeler). Update website. |
| **Laboratory activity:** Trip to Shep Brown & Associates (tile store). Complete simple planned project in the Hobby Shop. 

| WEEK 4 |

|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} **Classroom Topic: :** Finalizing the Design {{< br >}}{{< br >}} *   Critique/Presentation of final designs (sketches and solid models showing different possible color combinations){{< br >}}*   Materials and packaging{{< br >}}*   Manufacturing planning {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| **Homework to present:** Teams present final, full-scale layout of the tiles, completed as a solid model, with several different color and illumination schemes. |
| **Homework to start:** Make changes as needed to the designs and begin detailed part design/waterjet path planning. Create a detailed schedule for the rest of the semester showing what each team member will do, and weekly milestones to be accomplished. Update website. |
| **Laboratory activity:** Purchase parts and start manufacturing.
